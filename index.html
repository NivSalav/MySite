        <p>
            My name is Niv Salav, I am 30 years old, married to Miriam, and father of two lovely children, Emma (4 years old) and Ariel (11 months old).<br>
            I live in Ashkelon and work as a payroll accountant and human resources manager at a company that manufactures playgrounds throughout the country and abroad.<br>
            I chose to do a career change to the world of technology for the position of software testing - QA because my main profession of payroll accountant has pretty much exhausted itself. I want to pursue something I always loved and wanted to learnâ€”the world of technology and in particular QA.<br>
            From a young age, I have loved technology, and working with software and encountering bugs piqued my interest in what happens behind the scenes and how it works.
