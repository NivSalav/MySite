        <h2 id="About me">About me</h2>
			<p> My name is Niv Salav, I am 30 years old, married to Miriam and father of 2 lovely children, Emma - 4 years old and Ariel - 11 months old.<br>
I live in Ashkelon and work as a payroll accountant and human resources manager at a company that manufactures playgrounds throughout the country and abroad.<br>
I chose to do a career change to the world of technology for the position of software testing - QA because I recently changed jobs and I also work in human resources, I do not connect with human resources
 and the main profession of payroll accountant has pretty much exhausted itself, I do not have the passion I had at
 the beginning and I decided that I would do something for myself, something that I always loved and always wanted to learn with all the difficulty - the world of technology and in particular QA.<br>
From a young age I have loved and connected to technology and later when I started working with software and encountered bugs I became interested in what was happening behind the scenes and how it works.</p>
